def aurora_login_required():
    """
    Decorator for views that checks that the user is authenticated by checking
    if the user has logged in correctly and has the right permissions:

     - Every user has to authenticate using his password
     - A staff user can visit every course
     - A normal user can visit just the course he is enlisted in

     This decorator works just for views for whose url contains the course short title.
     It is then extracted and used to authenticate the user.

    Usage: Put @aurora_login_required() right above a view function. Remember to not forget the brackets.

    TODO: discuss if it would be better to use first view argument as course_short_title
     instead of extracting course_short_title from request path. It would imply that every view
     using the @aurora_login_required() decorator has a course_short_title as first parameter.
